# CGTFS - a C library to read static GTFS feeds {#mainpage}

A thin and fast low-level library which reads GTFS static feeds. This library provides a readable and intuitive C interface for parsing data provided in the Google's [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format.

## Build process and dependencies

### Dependencies

One of the development goals was to keep the dependencies as minimal as possible. So far, CGTFS has following dependencies:

  - [greatest](https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest) for tests
  - [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for fast & efficient querying *built through [a special cmake-friendly repo](https://github.com/rakhack/sqlite3-cmake)*

### Build process

The library should compile on `gcc >= 4.8.4`, `clang >= 5.0.0` and latest Microsoft's C/C++ compiler.

Configuration: `Release` or `Debug`.

#### Linux

```
$ cd /path/to/cgtfs/
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ mkdir build && cd build/
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=%Configuration% ..
$ cmake --build .

$ ./tests
```

#### Windows

```
cd \path\to\cgtfs\
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config %Configuration%

%Configuration%\tests.exe
```

## Documentation

The library is heavily documented via code comments. You are encouraged to compile them into HTML.

```
$ doxygen
```

If you want to get started with this library by reading only one (1) file, you are out of luck. But you can get by reading just three (2 more) files:

  1. this page
  2. @ref data_transition
  3. @ref api_overview
